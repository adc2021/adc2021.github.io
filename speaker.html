					<h6><b>Title: </b><i>Translational Healthcare Research from System and Data Perspectives</i></h6>
					<p align="justify"><b>Abstract:</b> While AI and data-driven approaches are still evolving, they are likely to surpass current medical practices in the healthcare domain soon. The potential advantages are not only faster and more accurate analysis, but also the democratization of healthcare services. Notwithstanding, there are  some common challenges when applying existing approaches onto the healthcare domain, due to the noise and bias of electronic health records (EHR), complex and heterogeneous feature relations, access control and data privacy and etc. In this talk, I shall discuss our design and implementation strategies: solve common challenges, instill domain knowledge, automate knowledge extraction, and enable system-based global optimization. I discuss our rationale on building a general analytics stack instead of solving individual problems, and explain how these challenges are being addressed. Several detailed technologies from both system and algorithm perspectives in our healthcare data management and analytics framework are also described.  I shall also discuss our new translational project on reducing 3H (hyperglycemia, hypertension, hyperlipidemia) problems.

					<h6><b>Title: </b><i>A Tale of Learning Databases</i></h6>
					<p align="justify"><b>Abstract: </b> The ability to perform timely, predictable and cost-effective analytical processing of large data sets to extract deep insights is a key ingredient to the success of many industrial and government domains (e.g., internet search, marketing firms, telecommunications, and healthcare). Traditional database management systems (DBMS) are, however, not the first choice for servicing these modern applications, due to long preparation steps required to set up the DBMS for analysis.

In this talk, I am going to show that the game is not lost for traditional DBMSs. I will demonstrate that traditional DBMSs can still provide timely, predictable, and cost-effective analytics and join the race of servicing modern applications, if they embrace an adaptive and agile approach in which the query processing strategy is learned on the go and adjusted during query processing to fit the characteristics of: i) the user query requests (workload), ii) the data, and iii) the underlying hardware. In particular, workload-driven learning is introduced as a means of enabling efficient data exploration and reducing the time to first insight. Data-driven learning alleviates suboptimal query processing strategies by automatically transforming the access strategy during query processing to fit the observed characteristics of the data. Finally, hardware-driven learning is an example of the adaptation of the DBMS engine to the properties of new hardware technology (cold storage) as a cost-effective solution for storing the ever-increasing customer data base.</p>

					<h6><b>Title: </b><i>Group Search in Location-Aware Social Networks</i></h6>
					<p align="justify"><b>Abstract: </b> The online social networks have greatly changed the way that people interact with each other and also with the world. With the proliferation of wireless communication techniques and GPS-equipped mobile devices (e.g., smart phones), nowadays people are able to access the social networks almost anywhere at anytime. The location information plays an important role in social network applications, because the geographical information brings social networks from virtual to reality, bridging the gap between the physical world and online social networking services. We will discuss how to efficiently search a group of objects (e.g., a community, a region, and a route etc) in such location-aware social networks.

					<h6><b>Title: </b><i>Cohesive Subgraph Computation over Large Sparse Graphs</i></h6>
					<p align="justify"><b>Abstract: </b> With the rapid development of information technology, huge volumes of graph data are accumulated. An availability of rich graph data not only brings great opportunities for realizing big values of data to serve key applications, but also brings great challenges in computation. Real graphs are sparsely connected from a global point of view, but they usually contain subgraphs that are locally densely connected. Computing cohesive/dense subgraphs can either be the main goal of a graph analysis task, or act as a preprocessing step aiming to reduce/trim the graph by removing sparse/unimportant parts such that more complex and time-consuming analysis can be conducted. In this talk, I will give an introduction to the models and algorithms for the problem of cohesive subgraph computation.					</p>

					<h6><b>Title: </b><i>Advanced Social Influence Maximization Computing over Large Social Networks</i></h6>
					<p align="justify"><b>Abstract:</b> 
Social media has become an emerging platform for organizations to broadcast their policies, for companies to advertise their products, and for people to propagate their opinions. In the social media data analytics, one of the most significant problems is the influence maximization problem. Given a social network and a campaign budget, the goal of influence maximization problem is to identify a set of influential users that are most likely to influence the maximum number of users in the social network. Meanwhile, the selected user set size is limited to the specified campaign budget. Thus, the small set of selected users can help campaign organizers to improve their marketing, branding, and product adoption in a profitable way. 

At this seminar, Jianxin will first introduce some background knowledge about social influence and the traditional influence maximization problem, and then give an overview about the recent research on the problem from different perspectives – topic-aware, location-aware, community-aware and target-aware. The presenter will mainly explain the motivation of such novel problems, the new insights, the procedure of defining these problems in an easy way, the optimization techniques in solving such problems, and their experimental evaluations. The main goal in presenting this seminar is to help audiences to know and understand the different applications of social influence in need, how the influence models are devised, the existing research challenges and the state-of-the-arts in this topic. This presentation is suitable to a broad audience who have interest in data science.
